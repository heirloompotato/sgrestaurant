# Restaurant Food Picker
The Restaurant Food Picker is a Telegram bot designed to solve the problem "Where should we eat?". The food picker suggests restaurants based on a list of filters - price, rating, cuisine and location.

## Directory Layout
- `constants` contains the list of filters and text messages.
- `database` contains an example database.
- `initiation DB` and `filters` initiate the database and define how data is retrieved from the database.
- `keyboardBuilder` defines functions used to build the text on the inline keyboard.
- `bot.py` contains the code for deployment.
